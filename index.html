                Hello! My name is Alexander Roe. I'm currrently studying mathematics and computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
                Most recently, I was a course assistant for <a href="https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs126/sp2020/">CS 126</a>, a software design class.
            </p>
            <p id="interests">
                I'm most interested in exploring the musical applications
                of computer science. I also have general interests in 
                number theory, machine learning, and intuitive learning
                through visualizations.
            </p>
