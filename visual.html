        <h2>Visualizing limits.</h2>
        <p>
          The formal definition of a limit of a sequence is as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          A sequence $(a_n)$ has a limit $L$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists some $N \in \mathbb{N}$ so that for all
          $n \geq N$, $|a_n -  L| < \epsilon$.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Often in math, theorems and definitions look complicated, but they actually represent a very clear, intuitive
          concept that is not difficult to understand given enough effort. Let's look at some visuals to unpack this definition.
        </p>
        <h4>What's a limit, informally?</h4>
        <p>
          A limit is essentially what the terms in the sequence seem to approach. <br>

          A simple example is $a_n = 5$ for all $n$. <br>
            Since all the terms in the sequence are 5, the limit is clearly 5. <br>
          
          Another example is $a_n = \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} = 1, 1 - \frac{1}{2}, 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}, 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4}, ...$ <br>
            Interestingly, $\lim a_n = \ln{2}$. The limit of this isn't obvious at all. <br>
          
          One more example: $a_n = \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{p_n} = \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7}, ...$, where $p_n$ is the $n$th prime. <br>
            This sequence actually diverges (!). This is logically equivalent to saying the limit does not exist. <br>
        </p>
        <h4>What do the symbols mean?</h4>
        <p>
          First off, $L$ is the limit of the sequence. I'm going to assume the sequence has real numbers only. Thus, $L \in \mathbb{R}$. <br>
          
          Next, $\epsilon$ (epsilon) usually denotes a small positive real number. Of course, it can be any positive real number, but 
          when you see $\epsilon$, you should think small. <br>

          Next, $N$ is any natural number. So $N \in {1, 2, 3, ...}$. <br>

          Now, we distinguish between $n$ and $N$. In the formal definition, $N$ is fixed. However, $n$ is any
          natural number greater than $N$. For example, let's say $N = 500$. Then, $n$ can be 500, 501, 502, 10000, etc. <br>
        </p>
        <h4>Formal definition in simpler terms.</h4>
        <p>
          Basically, the formal definition says this:
          <blockquote>
            If the limit of the sequence $a_n$ is $L$, then the terms get very close to $L$.
          </blockquote>
          Let's add a bit more rigor:
          <blockquote>
            If the limit of the seuquence $a_n$ is $L$, then the terms are at most $\epsilon$ away from $L$.
          </blockquote>
          Now we have a small issue. Let's say $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$, and $\epsilon = 0.1$. Clearly, the limit is 0.
          But the first few terms are more than 0.1 away from 0.
